*Classical Chinese Works Revivified*

This is a demo repository of my hobby project learning to typeset hard-to-find Classical and Literary Chinese works into a modern-ish format with LuaTeX and LuaTeXja.

Projects here are work in progress.

Currently texts are sourced from CBETA 漢文大藏經 (http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/).

This project is directly inspired by [[https://lindypress.net/][www.lindypress.net]].
